# Algorithms

This document presents how different algorithms are used and where they are used:
- in game theory
- in descriptive statistics of any given data
- in statistics and continuous laws 
- the algorithm's complexity (i.e temporal and spatial)
- in cryptography (to cipher and decipher messages)
- in graphs 
- and lastly in graph coloring
